          I was a game programmer at Streamline Studios early in my career
          before transitioning into web dev, creating dashboards and virtual
          events such as MYDCF 2021 and Level Up KL 2020.

          {" "}
          I moved on at GoKudos to get into mobile development and now am at
          KodeBaze where I deal with custom dashboards and platforms for
          Kodecrew, Drakkar and Aarsleff.
        </p>

        <p>
          {" "}
          In these roles, Iâ€™ve used React, Redux, Next. js, and others modern
          tools, always with focus on clean, performant code.
